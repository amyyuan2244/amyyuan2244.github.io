             in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of shelter from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 
             to the current times in the context of the percent change in the CPI of other categories
              of commodities and services during this same time period.<br> <br>
            According to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which gathers data for 
            and calculates the CPI, the CPI defined as a "measure of the average change over
            time in the prices paid by urban consumers [in the United States of America] 
            for a market basket of consumer commodities and services." The specific commodities and services
            in this "market basket" may change over time. The CPI  tracks the month-to-month changes 
            in the prices of those commodities and services relative to their prices in a base period 
            of time in the 1980s. The exact base year used to calculate the CPI varies by the good/service.
            <br> <br> The BLS often presents data on the CPI in terms of 12-month percent 
            changes across different categories of commodities and services. Instead of a 12-month period,
            this narrative visualization instead explores the CPI in the time period from the start 
            of the pandemic to current times. While it’s difficult to place an exact date on when a 
            pandemic starts, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 
            of 2020. Hence, this narrative visualization will use March 2020 as the start of the pandemic. 
            As of the creation of this narrative visualization, the most recent CPI data available is from 
            June 2025. Thus, this narrative visualization will explore the percent change in the Consumer 
            Price Index (CPI) of shelter from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 to the current
            day in June 2025. <br> <br> This visualization focuses specifically on shelter during 
            this time period because rents (and housing costs in general) spiked during the COVID 
            pandemic, particularly in a lot of metro areas.This narrative visualization seeks to examine
            the percent change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of shelter from the start of the COVID-19
                pandemic to the current times in the context of the percent change in the CPI of other categories
                of commodities and services during this same time period.
